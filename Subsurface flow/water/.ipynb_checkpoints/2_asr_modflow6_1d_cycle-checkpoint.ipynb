The aquifer extends from $x=0$ to $x=L$ in the $x$ direction, where $L$ is chosen far enough away not to effect the flow solution.  Water is injected at the left side at a rate $U$ such that the average velocity in the aquifer is 1 m/d. The head is fixed on the right side to $h_R$. Flow is considered to be at steady state instantaneously. \n",
