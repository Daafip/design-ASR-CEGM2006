 for designing an ASR system for the course CEGM2006


## Background
A drinking water company wants to build an ASR system to store drinking water for use during
the summer peak demand. The aquifer that they want to use consists of sand, is approximately
20 m thick, and the hydraulic conductivity is somewhere in the range 10 m/d till 40 m/d. Water in
the aquifer is salty with a concentration of 30 g/L. The drinking water company wants to store
enough drinking water such that they can extract a total of 40,000 m 3 of drinking water during the
summer months of July and August.
## Expectations
- Design an ASR system such that the drinking water company can extract a total of 40,000 m 3 of
drinking water during the summer months of July and August.
- Develop a schedule for injection, extraction and, if you wish, storage.
- Design the system such that the waste of injected drinking water is as small as possible.
- Make sure you meet the guidelines for injection pressure and maximum velocity during
extraction.
- Demonstrate that the ASR system can function for at least 10 years with possibly a start-up year
when the extracted volume is smaller.
- Discuss the uncertainties in your design.
- Report and present your findings.
